<b>Project Title:</b> Touch Ten

<b>Project Task:</b> Create a simple game with webview as a game over screen. Game is about touching an aim 10 times as fast as you can.

### Description

To solve this problem I used a simple `offset` animation limited within the screen of the device.

What would win need to have time to press all the buttons in 7 seconds. Depending on the result after that will open one or another website using `WebKit`
